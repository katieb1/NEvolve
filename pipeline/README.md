# pipeline folder

This is a first pass at what the final folder structure of the project will look like with a pipeline. This of course is all subject to change, but at the moment the outputs of simulation runs should be stored in `data/`, metadata from the simulation run including input parameters, labels, etc. should be stored in `metadata/`, `msms.py` is a python module for functions and classes that relate to `msms` (the program used to generate training data), and `main.py` is for testing / playing around.
